The program was performed in windows platform.

To compile the program type:- g++ -o Q6 Q6.cpp
To get the output type:- Q6


The program takes so less time that it cannot be calculated for single iteration.
So we have iterated the code for 1 million for every function.

Time required by binary exponent is 36897000 ns
Time required by square and multiply method of exponentiation is 26929000 ns
Time required by conventional method is 27927000 ns

So from the above result square and multiply method of exponentiation is better.
